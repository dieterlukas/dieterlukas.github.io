    "text": "You finished a research study and have results to share? Congrats! You probably want to share it with as many people as possible: your boss, other scientists, maybe the patent office, politicians, decision makers, journalists, the public?\nWho you want to reach determines how the results are shared.\nI learned about a phrase coined by M. McLuhan: “The medium is the message: a message is the change of scale or pace or pattern that a new invention or innovation introduces into human affairs.” The idea is that I don’t just want to transmit information: the hope is that when people hear the message, this will change something for them. And the same message will be perceived very differently depending on how and where it is being shared.\n\n\nAs scientists, the common medium we use to share our findings are scientific papers. For our study, we published a scientific paper about our results on infanticide in mammals because we were hoping that this would lead to changes in how other scientists conduct their research. They might start to look at a new question, rely on our findings for the rationale for their study, consider additional factors we discussed, rely on a new method, or interpret their results in a different way. Scientific articles, the medium to reach other scientists, therefore focus on including hypotheses, a description of the methods, include figures, and a discussion linking the findings to a broader literature. The format matches what we hope to change in the readers.\n\n\nThe same results were portrayed very differently in the boulevard press. There, information is often presented to create an emotional reaction and gossip. The focus is on the sensationalised human aspect, rather than specific details. Here, the medium also matches with what is hoped to be achieved.\n\n\nSo, what is the purpose of the medium of the press release?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe thought that the results of our study could be of interest to many people: they deal with sex and violence. We found that in several mammalian species the greatest risk for infants come from others of their own species. The reversible nature of male infanticide reveals how sexual conflict can lead to repeated evolution of male strategies and female counter-strategies.\n\n\n\n\nThe action that is hoped for by writing and sharing a press release is that journalists will report on the study. Journalists have access to share the study in ways I don’t have. They also have specialised skills to frame the findings in particular ways that can reach other audience, they are effective in phrasing information for other media forms. Journalists often also add context to studies, for example by reaching out and interviewing other scientists. In addition though, the press release is also a way to summarize the main findings for a general audience.\n\n\nSo the important bit is to figure out the message you want to transmit via your medium to your particular audience. Find out in part 2 how to narrow down your message."

    "text": "You finished your study and you have your results. We now need to consider how to explain the results so that people are able to interpret them in a way that is relevant to them - what is the story?\nWe need to distill the complexity of our research into a message that’s meaningful for who we want to reach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, the best is to have your message be as long as necessary but as short as possible. One approach I have been using is the Message Box developed by Nancy Baron, the communications specialist at COMPASS. The approach focuses on putting yourself in the perspective of your desired audience, and relate your findings to problems they encounter and actions they might take based on your findings. When considering the message, it can often help to try to think back to why you decided to study this question in the first place.\n\n\nReaching your audience usually requires an emotional connection. You want them to be surprised, fascinated, shocked, excited, all of the above, so they engage with your message. So it is important to consider how people might react to your message. The same facts can be interpreted in very different ways. That partly depends on the background of your audience, so you might want to consider to focus on aspects that are likely shared even by people who come from a very different perspective.\nHere is an exercise for considering the emotional connection and different ways to interpret the same observation: the kitchen call. The exercise has you imagining yourself in the living room, while your partner is busy in the kitchen. You come across your study, and go ‘wow’. So obviously your partner wants to know what got you excited, so you shout across what got you excited in one sentence. The exercise focuses on the idea that you don’t want to simply summarize your findings, but get across what you want people to remember about your study.\n\n\nOne alternative approach to finding your message I have been taking is trying to visualize the key aspects. For this, you could use photos, drawings, or graphics. Visualizing a message usually forces you to focus on the key points and is often also linked to an emotional reaction. Even if you use a different approach to identify your key message, it is always useful to include visuals as part of your press release and outreach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor our male infanticide study, we used some photos of species that represent particular situations in which either male strategies or female counter-strategies appear to be effective. For the counter-strategies, we found that females protect offspring from infanticide by forcing males to compete through sperm instead of violence. The intensity of sperm competition is shown by this male grey mouse lemur.\nPlease note: the animal in the photo was handled as part of a research project, with all relevant permits, and released immediately after. They are not pets.\n\n\n\n\nNow that you have identified your key message and what you want people to take away from your study, find out in part 3 how convey this information within the format of the press release."

    "text": "Your press release is out there in the world - so what now. Well, for most of the press releases I have sent out, very little happens. There is so much research being released everyday, of which only a small amount can be covered. Accordingly, you can’t take it personally if your press release is not picked up by other outlets or journalists.\nIt’s worth it for me to write a press release even if nothing else happens.\n\n\nUsually the press release will at least be published by your research institution. That means you have a summary for a general audience that you can point people to in case they have questions. Going through the process of considering the key message of the study also helps in future interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur study on infanticide by female mammals did not get picked up by the press when we published it. Preparing the materials for the press release was still helpful: we shared it ourselves on social media, and having the concise summary helped me to present on the study.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s exciting though to get interest from journalists!\nThe interactions can happen in different ways: you might get an email with some questions, a phone call, or be invited for a live interview. In many instances, the interactions will be scheduled at relatively short notice because journalists usually work to a deadline, like the publication date of your study. It helped me to prepare some statements:\nFirst, they key findings: while the journalists will have read the press release and the manuscript, this is my chance to convey in my own words what I think is most important\n\nNext, the explanation for how I did it: this is harder than I thought, because people want to know what I actually did, how did I get that result, in sufficient detail but a way that is accessible.\n\nAlso, it’s worth to have examples: this is similar to the vizualisations in the printed press release, a great way to connect with the audience, make them feel like they are there with you.\nFinally, be aware that stories are often build around drama: drama can be that something is finally resolved, it can be that the findings contradict what others have said, or go against what people commonly assume.\nWhile the interviews can be stressful, I try to enjoy the interactions. The questions usually make me see my research in a new way, and open up avenues I hadn’t considered. And I am usually excited about what I found out, so I want to share that. I am also not worried about potentially missing details or simplifying things. That also means that I do not ask to check a transcript or to get final approval before a story is printed. Trust science journalists. Those who contact you actually make an effort to report correctly. It is also not different from a live radio interview. But do check the press release carefully! This is the official statement. This is the point of reference that will be distributed most widely.\n\n\nIn case your study garners interest, you might want to track the reactions. Find out in part 5 how you might find out what people think about your findings."

    "text": "Your press release is out there in the world, you might have gotten some interest from journalists, so how to see whether people are interested in your story and what they think about it?\nI check where our findings end up and who they might have reached\n\n\nTracking where the story ends up can be helpful in case you need to report outreach as part of grants or to your university. It can also be of interest to see how your research is being perceived and what connections other people might make.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo check whether your story was covered in any news outlets, the easiest way is to check Google News. To narrow results down, especially if a bit of time has passed, you could add the name of the authors.\n\n\n\nMost coverage will link back to your scientific article. Another way to track attention therefore can be Altmetrics, which provides an overview of which news, blogs, and social media link to your study.\n\n\n\nTracking attention on social media has become a bit more complicated: there are different services, and some do not have a straightforward search function. One alternative could be to check posts by science journalists.\n\n\n\n\nWhat to expect in terms of coverage?\nMost reports will be good. I think the mostly widely read stories are those by journalists that make an effort to ensure that their story is correct. Many other outlets publish the press release in full or quote from the release. I will only know about the bad reports after they have been published so there is not much I can do about them. Though, all of these reports rely on information I originally release - the paper, the press release, email replies, or phone interviews. So it is worth spending effort on the material that I can control.\nReactions on social media are similarly difficult to control. It might be worth engaging in exchanges, but it is worth to be aware that this is more difficult for some individuals in particular given the risks of backlash, and that you do not owe anyone your time who does not interact in an honest fashion."

    "text": "Press releases are the main way to get information to journalists, they are as defined on Wikipedia an “official statement delivered to members of the news media for the purpose of providing information, creating an official statement, or making an announcement directed for public release. Press releases are also considered a primary source, meaning they are original informants for information.”\nPress releases have a very specific format and content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile scientific papers go from broad context to the very specific details of your study, press releases are like an inverted triangle: “instead of setting out context and working towards findings - you start with top attention-grabbing findings and then work outwards.” (thanks to Fred Lewsey for explaining this to me). The figure above, from Nancy Baron’s book “Escape from the Ivory Tower”, illustrates how scientists might have to rethink presenting information to a different audience.\n\n\nWithin that triangle, there is a very specific format for press releases. I illustrate this based on our press release for the study on infanticide by females:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeadline\nintroduces the topic\nInfanticide by mammalian mothers\n\n\nMain result in one sentence\nthe message you identified in the previous step\nFemale mammals kill the offspring of their competitors when resources are scarce\n\n\nSummary\nlists: who, what, when, where, why\nJULY 15, 2019\nThe killing of rivals’ offspring represents a violent manifestation of competition, and a significant source of offspring mortality in some mammalian populations. Previous research on such infanticide has focused on males, but a new study by Dieter Lukas from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and Elise Huchard from the Institut des Sciences de l’Évolution, Montpellier shows that infanticide by females is also widespread across mammals and that females are likely to gain substantial benefits from it.\n\n\nBackground\nincludes explanations, examples, and quotations\ne.g. “All these circumstances have in common that infanticide occurs when the proximity of offspring born to other females directly threatens the killer’s reproductive success by limiting access to the resources that are most critical for her own offspring: access to breeding space, milk, offspring care, or social status”, says Huchard.\n\n\n\n\nPress releases are considered a primary source. This is your statement to the public. That means you should also include your motivations for the study, what you found challenging or exciting, and describe how you obtained the results. Despite the tendency to see sensationalized statements, research indicates that readers actually might trust your findings more if you are open about the challenges, the uncertainty, and the limitations.\nAs mentioned in part 1, press releases are mainly targeted at journalists, who have very specific expectations of what they should contain. But the press releases will also get published as is, quoted in other reports that are written without further contact, and used as starting point for interviews. It can also be a source for you to point back to in case of potential misinterpretations and misattributions.\n\n\nThere is a lot of helpful information online on how to prepare press releases (e.g. from the National Institutes of Health, European Space Agency, Deutscher Fachjournalisten Verband). This can also be a task where a large language model might get you a first draft to show the structure based on the message and take-away you identified.\n\n\nMost universities and research centers have professional help available for you to finalise your press release. You will want to contact them anyway because they are able to distribute your press release through the appropriate channels such that they will reach as many journalists as possible.\n\n\nOnce you have your press release ready, you need to let it go. Find out in part 4 what to do next."
