In most social mammals,                <br>                individuals arrange themselves in dominance hierarchies that                govern <br>                access to resources while reducing open aggression. A new study                new <br>                study by Shivani (Indian Institute of Science Education and                Research <br>                Kolkata), Elise Huchard (Institut des Sciences de l’Évolution, <br>                Montpellier), and&nbsp; Dieter Lukas (Max Planck Institute for                Evolutionary <br>                Anthropology) brings together evidence from various mammalian                societies to show that differences in dominance ranks among                females generally translate into inequalities in their                reproductive success. <br>              </span></font><font size="+2"><span style="color: black;"><br>                Previous authors had argued for such an association between rank                and <br>                reproductive success, but it was unclear how to reconcile                existing data <br>                where authors had not found such an association. "We developed a                series of predictions to assess when we would expect rank to                lead to <br>                differences in reproductive success in females", says Shivani.                "We <br>                checked these predictions by external reviewers, before testing                them <br>                with comparative data from 86 different mammalian species". <br>                <br>                The researchers found that higher dominance rank can be linked                to different measures of higher reproductive success. In                particular, higher ranking females often have more and larger                offspring, and they have shorter intervals between births                compared to lower ranking ones. While the particular fitness                link might differ depending on local conditions, dominant                females appear better off in one way or another in almost all                societies.<br>              </span></font><br>            <font size="+2"><span style="color: black;">In addition, high rank                was found to be more strongly related to higher <br>                reproductive success in species in which females have large                litters with <br>                short inter-birth intervals, while differences among females                were not as <br>                pronounced when females only have single offspring at long                intervals. <br>                Effects were also stronger in societies such as those of                meerkats, where <br>                cooperatively breeding groups are closed to immigrants and                females have strong social bonds including helping each other                raise offspring. <br>                "Surprisingly though, dominance rank was not more important in                harsh <br>                environments", says Huchard, "and the inequalities of having                different <br>                social ranks also arise under conditions we would consider                benign." <br>                <br>              </span></font><font size="+2"><span style="color: black;">The                association between rank and reproductive success are far from <br>                perfect, and in most societies, all females, even the                lowest-ranking <br>                ones, do reproduce. Nevertheless, even such small initial                differences <br>                might have long-term consequences. Dominance rank is often                inherited in matrilines, because daughters of dominant mothers                often have better <br>                starting conditions plus might receive the support of their                mother to <br>                obtain their own social position in the group. Benefits                therefore can <br>                build up, potentially leading to large variation in the                long-term growth <br>                of different matrilineal lineages. "Dominance structures are                often <br>                reinforcing, and through inheritance high ranking females might                not only <br>                themselves benefit from their position but also pass those                privileges on <br>                to future generations", says Lukas.</span></font></td>          <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 2%;"><br>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td style="vertical-align: top;"><br>          </td>          <td style="vertical-align: top;"><br>          </td>          <td style="vertical-align: top;"><br>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <font size="+2"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></font>    <br>    <noframes> Ihr Browser kann diese Seite leider nicht anzeigen! </noframes> <br>  </body></html>
