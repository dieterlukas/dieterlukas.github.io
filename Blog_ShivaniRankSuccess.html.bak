In most                social mammals, individuals arrange themselves in dominance                hierarchies that govern access to resources while reducing open                aggression. A new study new study by Shivani (Indian Institute                of Science Education and Research Kolkata), Elise Huchard                (Institut des Sciences de l’Évolution, Montpellier), and&nbsp;                Dieter Lukas (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary                Anthropology) brings together evidence from various mammalian                societies to show that differences in dominance ranks among                females generally translate into inequalities in their                reproductive success. <br>                <br>                Previous authors had argued for such an association between rank                and reproductive success, but it was unclear how to reconcile                existing data where authors had not found such an association.                "Based on previous ideas", says Shivani, "we developed a series                of predictions to assess when we would expect rank to be linked                to reproductive success in females and when not, which we had                checked by external reviewers, before testing these predictions                with comparative data from 86 different mammalian species". <br>                <br>                The researchers found that higher dominance rank can be linked                to different measures of higher reproductive success. In                particular, higher ranking females often have more and larger                offspring, and they have shorter intervals between births                compared to lower ranking ones. While the particular fitness                link might differ depending on local conditions, dominant                females appear better off in one way or another in almost all                societies.<br>                <br>                In addition, high rank was found to be more strongly related to                higher reproductive success in species in which females have                large litters with short inter-birth intervals, while                differences among females were not as pronounced when females                only have single offspring at long intervals. Effects were also                stronger in societies such as those of meerkats, where                cooperatively breeding groups are closed to immigrants and                females have strong social including helping each other raise                offspring. "Surprisingly though, dominance rank was not more                important in harsh environments", says Huchard, "and the                inequalities of having different social ranks also arise under                conditions we would consider benign."<br>                <br>                The association between rank and reproductive success are far                from perfect, and in most societies all females, even the lowest                ranking ones, do reproduce. Nevertheless, even such small                initial differences might have long-term consequences. Dominance                rank is often inherited in matrilines, because daughters of                dominant mothers often have better starting conditions plus                might receive the support of their mother to obtain their own                social position in the group. Benefits therefore can build up,                potentially leading to large variation in the long-term growth                of different matrilineal lineages. "Dominance structures are                often reinforcing, and through inheritance high ranking females                might not only themselves benefit from their position but also                pass those priviliges on to future generations", says Lukas.</span></font></td>          <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 2%;"><br>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td style="vertical-align: top;"><br>          </td>          <td style="vertical-align: top;"><br>          </td>          <td style="vertical-align: top;"><br>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <font size="+2"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></font>    <br>    <noframes> Ihr Browser kann diese Seite leider nicht anzeigen! </noframes> <br>  </body></html>
